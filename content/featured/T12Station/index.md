Having struggled with understanding how advanced electrical circuit works, I made some projects to start learning again from the basic.

Soldering Station based on Hakko T12 handle. Learning from basic on progress to self-manufacturing PCB using CNC machine. Current heat controller built on native AVR ATMega coded on Atmel Studio. To be added soon.
